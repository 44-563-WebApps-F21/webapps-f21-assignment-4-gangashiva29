    <h4>Lady Windermere’s Fan </h4>
    <h6>ACT I. Morning-room in Lord Windermere’s house.
    The action of the play takes place within twenty-four hours, beginning
        on a Tuesday afternoon at five o’clock, and ending the next day at
        1.30 p.m.</h6>

    
    <p>LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]  I am quite
        miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.  [_Sits down at
        table L._]
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the
        whole evening.
        
        LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Smiling_.]  Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up,
        that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only
        things we _can_ pay.
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Shaking her head_.]  No, I am talking very seriously.
        You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don’t like compliments, and I
        don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when
        he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.
        
        LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, but I did mean them.  [_Takes tea which she offers
        him_.]
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Gravely_.]  I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to
        quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that.
        But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men
        are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes
        think you pretend to be worse.
        
        LORD DARLINGTON.  We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you make that your special one?  [_Still seated
        at table L._]
        
        LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Still seated L.C._]  Oh, nowadays so many conceited
        people go about Society pretending to be good, that I think it shows
        rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad.  Besides,
        there is this to be said.  If you pretend to be good, the world takes you
        very seriously.  If you pretend to be bad, it doesn’t.  Such is the
        astounding stupidity of optimism.
