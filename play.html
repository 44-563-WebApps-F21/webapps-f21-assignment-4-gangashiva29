        MRS. ERLYNNE.  No—no—

        LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes! he shall.  Had he come himself, I admit I would
        have gone back to the life of degradation you and he had prepared for
        me—I was going back—but to stay himself at home, and to send you as his
        messenger—oh! it was infamous—infamous.
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_C._]  Lady Windermere, you wrong me horribly—you wrong
        your husband horribly.  He doesn’t know you are here—he thinks you are
        safe in your own house.  He thinks you are asleep in your own room.  He
        never read the mad letter you wrote to him!
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  [_R._]  Never read it!
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  No—he knows nothing about it.
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  How simple you think me!  [_Going to her_.]  You are
        lying to me!
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Restraining herself_.]  I am not.  I am telling you the
        truth.
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  If my husband didn’t read my letter, how is it that you
        are here?  Who told you I had left the house you were shameless enough to
        enter?  Who told you where I had gone to?  My husband told you, and sent
        you to decoy me back.  [_Crosses L._]
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_R.C._]  Your husband has never seen the letter.  I—saw
        it, I opened it.  I—read it.
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Turning to her_.]  You opened a letter of mine to my
        husband?  You wouldn’t dare!
